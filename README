KafkaDB
=======

KafkaDB is a a Kettle-based framework for migrating data between databases with
different structures (ie. different versions of the same application) and has
been specifically designed to make transforms highly reusable, making it ideal
for module/plugin-based applications such as OpenERP and Tryton.

Requirements
------------

* Linux (maybe other UNIX based systems?)
* Java JDK: it works with openJDK
* Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle): http://kettle.pentaho.com/
  Extract the stable version in a relative path to KafkaDB directory
  (requirement to compile KafkaDB jar)

Installing
----------

# Get KafkaDB:
#* $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:angelnan/kafkadb.git
# Get submodules with OpenERPv5 -> Tryton project and KafkaDB's wiki
## $ git submodule init
## $ git submodule update
# Create a symbolic link to Kettle instalation path. *It must to be relative*
# Create a symboli link to the *.kettle* directory in your home
# Copy the content of *shared.xml* file in KafkaDB project into the same file
  in the _.kettle_ directory of your home. If you haven't used Kettle before
  you can replace the file.
  It defines the _source_ and _target_ connections based on variables from
  _kettle.properties_. Customize it if your source or target are not PostgreSQL
  databases.
# Compile the kafka.jar file:
#* $ ant package
# Copy the kettle.properties.template file to kettle.properties and customize
  database connections to source and target and the transformation path
  (the other options should works for you).
